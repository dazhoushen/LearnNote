Important:

+++ Installation using Windows' "Extract" function 

If you use the built-in "Extract" function to unpack the downloaded ZIP file, first "unblock" the ZIP file (right mouse click, Properties / General tab, bottom). Otherwise, all files will be blocked for security reasons, which may cause problems when opening the files. 

No problems when using other ZIP tools. 


+++ Windows Vista, 7, 8: 

Please install in a folder OUTSIDE "Program Files"!

This portable program writes data to the program folder by default(*), however, this is not allowed within the "Program Files" structure. In this case Windows would redirect the data files to a "VirtualStore" folder (under "Users"). 

(*) It is also possible to use a data folder of your choice (see help for more information).


+++ MemPad quick test:

For a quick test of MemPad's features drag&drop the "MemPad.help" file onto the MemPad.exe file. Read the Program/Installation section to get started. 

Note: The files from the "Example" subdirectory are required to test some advanced features in the help file. Please copy these files to the main directory.


+++ Embedded links with East-Asian characters: 

Links must be enclosed in <angle brackets> in order to be properly underlined and executed. 
See help:Editing/Links


+++ Software Update: 

Unzip the downloaded file into your existing folder. Your data will remain untouched.
