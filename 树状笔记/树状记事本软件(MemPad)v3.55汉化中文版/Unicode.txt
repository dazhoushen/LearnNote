MemPad Unicode - Note if you update from a MemPad version older than 3.50

Unicode allows different languages, like English, Russian and Chinese in the same text.

Starting with version 3.50 MemPad files are written with the Unicode encoding UTF-8.
These files cannot be opened with older MemPad versions!

Old MemPad files can be opened, but will be written as UTF-8.

Important:
Encrypted files of old MemPad versions can only be read if the password consists of ASCII letters. Please save these files without encryption before using them with MemPad 3.50.

Language files (see Folder "Languages"):

Language files have been converted to UTF-8 (except "Western languages").
Corrections or improvements are always welcome.
