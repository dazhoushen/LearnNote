MemPad File Format - in case you are interested

New 3.++ format ("String" is always terminated by zero byte)

File header              

    header:           string
        ident         constant "MeMpAd" 
        encoding      character, " " means Ansi, "." means UTF-8
        initial page  number to select at start (max. 5 characters)
        
    quick page path:  string (may be empty)

For each Page:

    level:            byte, binary 1..99 
    
    page title:       string (max 64 characters);
                      if a TAB character is found, the rest of the string
                      contains additional header information, currently the
                      background color code ($nnnnnn) 
                      
    page contents:    string 


Note: If the "MeMpAd " signature at the beginning of the file is not found, Mempad assumes that this file is encrypted, and asks for the password.
